    "Now that you've spent some time playing with a sample multivariate linear regression model, it's time to make your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've already gotten started by prepping the FBI:UCR Crime dataset (Thinkful mirror) in a previous assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this data, build a regression model to predict property crimes. You can use the features you prepared in the previous assignment, new features of your own choosing, or a combination. The goal here is prediction rather than understanding mechanisms, so the focus is on creating a model that explains a lot of variance.\n",

    "Submit a notebook with your model and a brief writeup of your feature engineering and selection process to submit and review with your mentor."

    "1. Download two datasets.  \n",
    "2. Run the predicitve model I created in challenge 2.3.3 on both data sets.   \n",
    "3. Evaluate the results to find out how consistently the predictive model works.\n",
    "4. Use error calculating mechanism I created to test the sentiment or span in the naive bayes' lessons to text for accuracy.\n",
    "5. Use the methods I learned in DSB Unit 5.1 to calculate the CI, R^2, pvalue, and Intercept and coefficients.\n",
    "6. Analyze the results of the calculations made in step 5, and write about them, and write about how to address any apparent problems that I notice.\n",
    "\n",
    "training a model means using sklearn's fit() method.  \n",
    "I will need X and a Y variables\n",
    "X is every feature that I want to go into the model that is not the outcome feature.  For example, if I am predicting property crime, I kick property crime out of X and make property crime Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then instantiate my linear regression model.  Next, I do the fit(X, Y).  This creates a linear regression model.\n",
    "Afterwards, I can call the following methods on the model: score(X,Y) or a predict(X) \n",
    "\n",
    "If I use Y_pred = NameIGiveTheRegressionModel.predict(X)\n",
    "Now, I can compare Y_pred to Y.  This will tell me the residual of the model against each data point.  (i.e. the residual is the distance between each data point and the line. There is one residual for each data point.  This is why I can plot the residual on the Y axis and also on the X axis.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To eveluate how good a model is at dealing with new data, do not refit the model.  Why?  Because if you do, it will be a different model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take my Oregon crime statistic data, make sure it has the same number of features, and in the same order as the New York crime statistic data.  This is because the model ignores column titles.  It only looks at the order in which they appear in the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Oregon_df\n",
    "X1 = all features I choose to use, except Property Crime.\n",
    "Y1 = Property crime.\n",

    "X = all features I choose to use, except Property Crime.  Y = Property crime. (I could call these X_train...and Y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once I run the do everything to X1 and Y1 that I did to the NewYork X and Y and run (plug them into) the same model as the variable that will be fit, ...Then I can compare them using score(X,Y) and predict (Y) and score(X1, Y1) and predict(X1)."
